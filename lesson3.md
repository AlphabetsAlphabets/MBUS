# Nature of organization


How an organization affects a government agency. When the buisness of an organization
is failing, the government will have a reduced income, which leads to reduced taxes,
so there will be less public facilities due to that.

### Advantages of being an internal and external stakeholder at the same time

### Who can be an internal and external stakeholder at the same time
- Staff (CEO, non-managerial employee)
- shareholder

If an employee buys shares in the company he works in, he can attend the annual general
meeting. And they can perform executive decisions as a non-managerial employee.

# Stakeholders
A group of people who are interested in the company, internal or external.

# public listed vs private listed company

- private is only for select people
