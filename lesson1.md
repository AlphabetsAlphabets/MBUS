# What is Management
Management is concerned with two things:
- Efficiency: Doing things right, and getting the most output for the least inputs.
- Effectiveness: Doing the right things, and attaining organisational goals.

### Efficiency
> Getting the most output for the least inputs.

Which each input is a resource that is used, the less resources are used the more
efficient it is. The resource and be either financial, or in terms of number of
workers needed to complete each task.

### Effectiveness
> Doing the right things.

If you can produce 100 units of product with very little resource you are efficient.
However, if 10 out of the 100 units are usable you are not effective. 

# What management strives for
Efficiency **and** effectiveness. By using the least amount of resources, to produce
a large quantity of product with a low defect rate. Will result in large profits.

**Usually** the more efficient something is the higher the profit gain due to lower
consumption of resources.

# Functional approach of managers
1. Functional approach
2. Roles approach (a.k.a Mintzberg approach)
3. Skills approach

Defining goals, and creating strategies to obtain results. Developing plans to 
coordinate activies.

- **O**(rganising)
Structuring work to accomplish goals set during the planning phase. This phase also
is responsible for allocating resources.

- **L**(eading)
Working with and through people to accomplish goals.

- **C**(ontroling)
Monitoring the set standard, and compare work between employees to see if the
standards are met. And corrective action will be taken to make sure employees 
reach the standard. If work done by an employee exceeds exceptations rewards 
will be given to said employee.

The most important phase is planning. Without proper planning, means workers have
no direction to follow which won't lead to anything.

### Roles

all tie together.

are given an amount of authority derived from having a position in the organization results
in the posession of status.  And the manager must be able to be all of these to some extent.

attending an employee's wedding.

keep their subbordinates on the right track, and making sure standards and deadlines are met.

to help the organization with said information. An advantage is obtained due to the information collected
from serving as a monitor.

> "The impact of managerial roles acting together is greater than the sum of their parts. Henry Mintzberg
> said that not all managers give equal amount of attention to each role. But access to 
> each of these roles is what makes an effective manager." - Henry Mintzberg
