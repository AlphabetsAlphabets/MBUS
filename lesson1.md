# What is Management
Management is concerned with two things:
- Efficiency: Getting the most output for the least inputs.
- Effectiveness: Doing the right things that will help the organization reach
the set goals.

### Efficiency
> Getting the most output for the least inputs.

Where each input is a resource and, the less resources are used the more
efficient it is. The resource and be either financial, or in terms of number of
workers needed to complete each task.

### Effectiveness
> Doing the right things.

If you can produce 100 units of product with very little resource you are efficient.
However, if 10 out of the 100 units are usable you are not effective. 

# What management strives for
Efficiency **and** effectiveness. By using the least amount of resources, to produce
a large quantity of product with a low defect rate. Will result in large profits.

**Usually** the more efficient something is the higher the profit gain due to lower
consumption of resources. 

# Three approaches managers take to be a successful manager
1. Functional approach
2. Roles approach (a.k.a Mintzberg approach)
3. Skills approach
There are t
### Functional 
It follows the **POLC** approach.
- **P**(lanning)  
Defining goals, and creating strategies to obtain results. Developing plans to 
coordinate activies.

- **O**(rganising)  
Structuring work to accomplish goals set during the planning phase. This phase also
is responsible for allocating resources.

- **L**(eading)  
Working with and through people to accomplish goals.

- **C**(ontroling)  
Maintaining the set standard, by comparing work between employees.  If the
standards are not met corrective action will be taken to make sure an employee's
reach the standards set. If work done by an employee exceeds exceptations rewards 
will be given to said employee.

The most important phase is planning. Without proper planning, workers have
no direction to follow which won't lead to anything.

# Mintzberg management model
### Roles
This approach is also known as the Mintzberg approach. It is composed of 3 roles, which
all tie together. 

What is a manager: Someone who is in charge of an organization or subgroup, and they
are given an amount of authority over the indivudals in the organization or subgroup.

### Interpersonal roles
Figurehead: responsible for performing ceremonial duties, taking a newly hired employee to lunch or
attending an employee's wedding.

Leader: they are accounted for the work and performance of their subbordinates. And they must therefore,
keep their subbordinates on the right track, and making sure standards and deadlines are met.

Liaison: The manager will interface with people inside or outside of the
organization.  Which allows them to form contacts with their peers, customers,
and suppliers which can serve as a valuable source of information.

### Informational roles
Important contacts and information is obtained through their informational roles.  

Monitor: As a monitor he/she will obtain crucial information from their collection of contacts. 
which the manager will relay to his/her subbordinates as soon as possible.

Disseminator: As a disseminator the manager will relay the information obtained from 
collection of contacts.

Spokeperson: A manager is also responsible for disseminating information to groups
outside of their organization. Whether it be through testimonies, conference
call with investors, or conversations with suppliers. They also deal with
governmental agencies, creditors, and investors. 

### Decisional roles
Entrepreneur: information obtained from their informational roles will allow the
manager together to help the organization with said information. An advantage
is obtained due to the information collected from serving as a monitor.

Disturbance handler: managers are responsible for responding to events that are
beyond their control, these events are usually too significant for a manager
to ignore. And some action form of action will be taken. For example events
such as natural disasters, or competitor actions.

Resource allocator: The manager will be responsible for who gets how much of
a resource.  Whether it be time, money, facilities, or extra staff for a task.
They also establish an organisational structure to their unit before implementation.

Negotiator: A manager is able to negotiate more effectively due the authority over an
organization or subgroup, and how much resource the organization or subgroup can use.
As well as, having information collected from their informational roles. 

> "The impact of managerial roles acting together is greater than the sum of their parts." - Unknown

> "Not all managers give equal amount of attention to each role. But access to 
> each of these roles is what makes an effective manager." - Henry Mintzberg

# Skills needed in a manager
<img src="images/Skills needed at different levels of management.png">

### Technical skills
The ability to perform techniques, or procedures in the field. That require 
in-depth and expert knowledge in the field. Such as performing a repair on a car, or
surgery. To perform these actions requires in-depth and expert knowledge. **Usually**,
the CEO of a hospital or an automobile repair center will not be able to perform these
activities.

First line managers, and middle maangers are very invovled in the technical aspect
of the organization.

Technical skills become less important in higher levels of management as different
skills are needed at different levels of management.

### Human/Interpersonal skill (or being a people person)
Managers deal with people to some extent in all levels of management. Managers
with good "people skills" will be more effective at motivating and encouraging
their subbordinates. To get the most of out each staff member.

### Conceptual skills
Individuals at top management must have exceptional conceptual skills in order
to make sense of abstract concepts. And to determine how a particular event
will affect the organization. In layman's terms to see the big picture. This is
**essential** for decision making.

Everything below this point are extra skills a manager needs

### Effectiveness skills
The ability to achieve organizational/departmental goals. Being able to
multitask, by working with other tasks in parrallel, and have negotiating
skills.
